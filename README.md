  Keep your Heroku App awaken forever.

## About

As a heavy user of heroku free tier accounts, I always stuck in the same problem when hosting my apps there: **After some minutes, the app gets in stand by and starts sleeping.**

So, with that in mind, I made **guardog**, an app that pings another heroku apps between a gap of 30 minutes, in order to keep them awake.

## Basic usage

- Browse into **[Guardog Site](https://guardog.herokuapp.com)**
- Type your heroku app name on the input field
- Click on "Keep my heroku app awaken forever!" button

If you want to stop pinging your app, do the following steps:

- Browse into **[Guardog Site](https://guardog.herokuapp.com)**
- Type your heroku app name on the input field
- Click on "Remove my heroku app" button
